Lovely to meet you virtually here :D.

I am always amazed by how human cognition works. Sparked by this interest, I have dedicated my academic career to cognitive psychology, from my undergraduate studies through to my current research. My work remains centred on human cognition, with a particular emphasis on cognitive processes underlying optimism in our future foresight.

Education and Training
======
I earned my Msci degree in Psychology from UCL, where I was fortunate to work alongside a community of brilliant researchers. My time there was defined by a dual fascination: the biological mechanics of the brain and the philosophical questions of the mind. Beyond the elegance of theory, I became fascinated by the tangible ways psychology shapes human behaviour. This realisation pushed me to move beyond the laboratory and adopt a more macro lens, exploring how human cognition navigates the vast complexities and uncertainties of the real world.

This journey led me to pursue a PhD degree under the supervision of Prof. George Wright and Dr. Ian Belton at the University of Strathclyde, whose research focuses on human judgments in anticipating the futures.

In short, I am a cognitive theorist who also wants to contribute to practical applications.

Research Interests
======
1. Every day, we form expectations about the future and plan our lives accordingly. Yet, we often have a natural tendency to be optimistic, which can leave us under-prepared for certain occasions - much like the common experience of forgetting an umbrella on a rainy day. This optimistic outlook isn't limited to our daily routines; it is surprisingly common in large-scale corporate strategies and global policy-making. My research looks at what this optimism looks like in the professional field of foresight. Also, I want to understand whether this mindset can be defined as a 'bias' or not. Ultimately, I am investigating how our thoughts about the future shape our ability to handle a world full of uncertainty.
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](https://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one Markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a Markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each Markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
